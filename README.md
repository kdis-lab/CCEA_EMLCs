# Co-EAGLET: CoEvolutionary AlGorithm for multi-Label Ensemble opTimization

Co-EAGLET is a coevolutionary algorithm, based on [EAGLET](https://github.com/kdis-lab/EAGLET).

In this repository we provide the code of Co-EAGLET, distributed under the GPLv3 License. Co-EAGLET has been implemented using JCLEC [[Ven08]](#Ven08), Mulan [[Tso11]](#Tso11), and Weka [[Hal09]](#Hal09) libraries.

*Yeast* [[Eli01]](#Eli01) multi-label dataset has been included in the repository as example; however, a wide variety of dataset are available at the [KDIS Research Group Repository](http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/).

More information about this algorithm will be provided soon.
