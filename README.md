# Cooperative CoEvolutionary Algorithm to build Ensembles of Multi-Label Classifiers

Co-EAGLET is a coevolutionary algorithm, based on the idea of [EAGLET](https://github.com/kdis-lab/EAGLET).
In this case, instead of one population, the algorithm uses several subpopulations at the same time.
Further, individuals are represented as lists and not binary arrays.

In this repository we provide the code of the algorithm, distributed under the GPLv3 License. It has been implemented using JCLEC [[Ven08]](#Ven08), Mulan [[Tso11]](#Tso11), and Weka [[Hal09]](#Hal09) libraries.

*Yeast* [[Eli01]](#Eli01) multi-label dataset has been included in the repository as example; however, a wide variety of dataset are available at the [KDIS Research Group Repository](http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/).

More information about this algorithm will be provided soon.
